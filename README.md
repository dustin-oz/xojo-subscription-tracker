# xojo-subscription-tracker
Desktop app written in Xojo to track personal subscriptions across multiple platforms, billing cycles, payment gateways and more.

This is one of my first attempts at writing software in Xojo.
This app idea came from the frustration I have always felt while trying to keep track of the multitude of monthly subscriptions I have accross different platforms like Roku or the Browser and things like payment gateways like Paypal or the App Store. This brings it all together in one place.
